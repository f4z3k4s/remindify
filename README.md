## Remindify

I decided to use Expo in this project for the sake of simplicity. In order to run the application, you only need the Expo XDE and the Expo mobile app.

1. [Expo installation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html)
2. `
git clone https://github.com/f4z3k4s/remindify
`
3. `
cd remindify && yarn
` ||
`
cd remindify && npm install
`
4. add remindify root dir to Expo XDE
5. open/run root dir in Expo XDE
6. click on share in the top right corner to get a QR code
(click on simulator instead of share if you'd like to run it on simulator) 
7. scan QR code with your iOS/Android device in the previously installed Expo app
8. app should start on your device without having XCode or Android Studio installed.

Time spent on project: ~10 hrs

Thank you for spending your time on reviewing my code, I wish you all a happy day :)
